		<h1> Eli Block's CNIT 132 Website</h1>
		<p> Hi all, I'm taking this course as part of the web programming certificate. 
			I graduated a year ago from Arizona State, majoring in finance. 
			Last year I worked in the auto industry in accounting, 
			but I decided to make a change and get into the tech industry here in SF. 
			I'm eager to learn all about web development so I hope we get the chance 
			to collaborate on cool projects.
